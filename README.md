# My Personal Website

For the first assignment of COMP20 (Web Development), I created my own personal website, which includes a link to my Resume, Biography, and GitHub page. 

Below is a brief description of the files included in the website.

## ```index.html```
This is the HTML file used to render the homepage of my website. In it are links to the other pages, as well as a photo of me. This page was formatted using ```menu.css```. I used a stylized unordered list to create the menu and give it a more aesthetically pleasing appearance.

## ```resume.html```
This is the HTML file used to render the resume page of my website. In it, I list my education, experience, awards, skills, and relevant activities. I mainly used headers and unordered lists to accomplish this. This page was formatted using ```text.css```.

## ```bio.html``` 
This is the HTML file used to render the biography page of my website. In it, I give a brief biography of myself. This page was formatted using ```text.css```.

## ```menu.css```
This is the CSS file used to format the homepage of my website. This CSS file needed to be separate from the one used to format other pages on the website because it modified the unordered list tag so that I could give it the appearance of a menu with multiple selectible buttons. 

## ```text.css``` 
This is the CSS file used to format the resume and biography pages of my website so that it would maintain similar visual effects as the homepage, but could also use normally styled unordered lists.
