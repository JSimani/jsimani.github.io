        <h1>Biography</h1>
        Hi! My name is Josh Simani. I am a 20-year old college student
        studying Computer Science at Tufts University in Massachusetts. I was 
        born and raised in Needham, Massachusetts, which is only 45 minutes
        away from campus. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with 
        friends, watching sports, and spending time with children. For the 
        past four years, I have worked at my childhood summer camp in New
        Hampshire as a camp counselor, working with 7- to 14-year olds across
        the camp. I also volunteer at the local Elementary School through the
        Leonard Carmichael Society to provide a fun after-school experience
        for children living in Medford.
