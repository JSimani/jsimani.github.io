        <h1>Biography</h1>
        Hi! I am a junior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at 
        Tufts University in Massachusetts. I was born and raised in Needham, 
        Massachusetts, which is only 45 minutes away from campus. <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, watching sports,
        and spending time with children. For the past four years, I have 
        worked at my childhood summer camp in New Hampshire as a camp 
        counselor, working with 7- to 14-year olds across the camp. I also 
        volunteer at the local Elementary School through the Leonard 
        Carmichael Society to provide a fun after-school experience for 
        children living in Medford.
